## Machine Learning Heart Disease Prediction Web App

The Machine Learning Heart Disease Prediction Web App was developed using the Django framework. The purpose of this app is to predict the likelihood of heart disease using advanced machine learning algorithms. 

To ensure accurate predictions, it incorporates data preprocessing techniques, feature selection methods, and model training procedures. By implementing these steps, a robust heart disease prediction system was developed.

In terms of user experience, an intuitive user interface was designed to enable users to easily interact with the app. This interface allows users to input their relevant medical data, facilitating the prediction process.
